Project Overview: Vulnerability Scanning Tool
Project Objective

The objective of this project is to create a simple yet effective vulnerability scanning tool that can identify common security vulnerabilities in a network or website. This tool will scan for open ports, detect outdated software versions, and identify common misconfigurations.
Key Features

    Port Scanning: Identifies open ports on the target machine to detect potential entry points for attackers.
    Outdated Software Detection: Checks the versions of software running on the target against known vulnerabilities.
    Misconfiguration Detection: Identifies common misconfigurations such as open directories, default credentials, etc.

Project Components

    Port Scanning Module: Uses socket to scan a range of ports (1-1024) on the target to identify which ones are open.
    Outdated Software Detection Module: Uses nmap to detect software versions and compares them to a (mock) database of known vulnerabilities.
    Misconfiguration Detection Module: Uses curl to check for common misconfigurations like open directory listings.

Technologies Used

    Python: The core programming language used for scripting the tool.
    Socket Library: For port scanning.
    Subprocess Module: To execute shell commands (e.g., nmap, curl) from within the Python script.
    Scapy Library: For more advanced network scanning if needed.

Detailed Functionality

    Port Scanning
        The script iterates through a range of ports (1-1024).
        For each port, it attempts to establish a connection.
        If a connection is successful, the port is marked as open.

    Outdated Software Detection
        The script runs nmap with service version detection.
        It parses the output to extract software names and versions.
        Compares extracted versions against a predefined list to identify outdated software.

    Misconfiguration Detection
        The script runs curl to fetch HTTP headers from the target.
        Checks the headers and response content for signs of misconfigurations like open directory listings.

User Interaction

    The user is prompted to enter the target IP address or URL.
    The script then performs the scanning and outputs the results in a human-readable format.

Example Usage

    Installation: Ensure Python and required libraries (scapy, socket) are installed.
    Running the Script:

    bash

    python vulnerability_scanner.py

    Input: The user enters the target IP address or URL.
    Output: The script displays the following information:
        List of open ports.
        List of outdated software detected.
        List of common misconfigurations identified.

Limitations

    Outdated Software Database: The current implementation uses a placeholder function. Integrating with an actual CVE database or vulnerability API is necessary for real-world use.
    Misconfigurations: Only a limited number of checks are implemented. Additional checks can be added for a comprehensive scan.
    Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented. More robust handling and logging mechanisms can be added.

Future Enhancements

    Integrate with CVE Databases: Automatically fetch and check software versions against a current database of vulnerabilities.
    Advanced Misconfiguration Checks: Include checks for SSL/TLS issues, weak passwords, etc.
    User Interface: Develop a graphical or web-based user interface for easier interaction.
    Reporting: Generate detailed reports in various formats (e.g., PDF, HTML) summarizing the findings.

This project provides a basic framework for vulnerability scanning and can be extended and improved to meet more advanced security requirements.
